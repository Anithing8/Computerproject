				<p>Some of his best-known works are Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World), Gora (Fair-Faced), Jana Gana Mana (the national anthem of India), and Amar Shonar Bangla (the national anthem of Bangladesh). He also wrote many short stories, novels, plays, essays, and songs that reflect his versatile genius and humanistic vision.</p>
				<p>Tagore was born on May 7, 1861 in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. He belonged to a wealthy and influential Brahmo family that was involved in social and religious reforms. He started writing poetry at a young age and published his first collection under the pseudonym Bhanusimha (Sun Lion) when he was sixteen. He also studied in England for a brief period but returned to India without completing his degree. He then managed his family's estates in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) and came in close contact with the rural life and culture of Bengal.</p>
				<p>Tagore was a pioneer of Bengali Renaissance and a vocal critic of British colonialism. He supported the Indian independence movement and participated in various political and social causes. He also founded Visva-Bharati University, a centre of learning and culture that attracted many eminent scholars and artists from India and abroad. He travelled extensively around the world and spread his message of universal humanism through his works.</p>
